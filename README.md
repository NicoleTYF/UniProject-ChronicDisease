## Feedback

* Overall, the document looks great and is well structured with very few spelling and grammatical errors. 
* The design demonstrates extensive application of knowledge and skills. The interface is appropriate for its purpose
and a clear iteration process has been documented. 
* The project's artefacts have been suitably organised. 
* In the document both functional and non-functional testing has been conducted and documented. It is clear that the results are being analysed and used for iterations and changes. To be improved would be to structure this section better, start off by letting the reader know how many test subjects there are in total (not just SUS) and are they the same ones used for Think-Aloud. Even more detailed and focused functional testing could have been conducted. 
* Teamwork has been managed beautifully even though I can read that there have been considerable challenges. 
* Meeting logs and reflections are well written. 
* Given the complexity of the application, client was very impressed with what this team has achieved
